# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.3.0]

Rspec-puppet now supports testing custom types, `:undef` values in params, structured facts, and checks resource dependencies recursively.

The settings in `module_path` and `manifest` are now respected throughout the code base. The former default for `module_path` (`'/etc/puppet/modules'`) was dropped to avoid accidentally poisoning the test environment with unrelated code.

To reduce the maintenance overhead of boilerplate code, rspec-puppet now provides some of the code that rspec-puppet-init deployed in helper files that you can just `require` instead.

This release also reduces memory usage on bigger testsuites drastically by reducing the caching of compiled catalogs.

### Changed
- Limit the catalogue cache to 16 entries. Significant memory savings and reduced runtime were observed in testing this.
- Prevent Puppet 3's \_timestamp fact from invalidating cache.
- Extracted catalog cache from RSpec::Puppet::Support.
- Updated README to use the rspec 3 syntax, and additional explanations.
- `contain_file(...).with_content(...)` will now only show the diff and not the full contents of the file.

### Added
- Custom type testing example group and matcher.
- before/require/subscribe/notify checking now searches recursively through all dependencies. `File[a] -> File[b] -> File[c]` is now matched by `contain_file('a').that_comes_before('File[c]')`, whereas earlier versions would have missed that.
- `let(:params)` now allows `:undef` to pass a literal undef value through to the subject.
- Support structured facts with keys as symbols or strings (\#295).
- rspec-puppet-init now creates smaller files, using rspec-puppet helpers, instead of pasting code into the module.
- Added a list of related projects to the README.

### Fixed
- Fix #276: `compile.and_raise_error` now correctly considers successful compilation an error
- Puppet's `modulepath` can now contain multiple entries and rspec-puppet will configure puppet to load code from all of them
- Support running with rspec 2.99 again
- non-class resources are now covered by the coverage code
- Fix #323/MODULES-2374: autorequires checking doesn't abort on "undefined method \`[]' for nil:NilClass"
- improved documentation for hiera integration, added example spec
- document the `scope` property
